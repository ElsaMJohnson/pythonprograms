####Fakesn.f produces a pixel list of simulated SNe within a simulated sky image. The list can be converted to an image in pyraf/iraf using rtextimage header = no. The final image is 1000x1000. Provided is an example of the image. The SNe are double gaussians, with sigmas = 1 and 2. Sky noise is added and all relevant parameters except image size can be changed. Image size and gaussians could be changed but presently they are written in the code.
